        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a brazillian enginneer, graduated by the <a href="https://www.poli.usp.br/departamentos/pea-energia-e-automacao-eletricas/">University of São Paulo on Elctrical Engineering with enphacis on energy and automation (PEA)</a> and during my graduation I also completed a Double Degree program receiving a master's degree in Engineering on Embedded Systems and Connected Devices by  <a href="https://phelma.grenoble-inp.fr/en/studies/master-s-degree-in-engineering-grenoble-inp-phelma-embedded-systems-and-connected-devices-seoc#page-presentation">Grenoble INP-École Nationale Supérieure de Physique, Électronique et Matériaux (Phelma).</a>
        Currently I'm a Software FullStack Engineer consultant working in finance at Paris - Ile de France.

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>For now I'm trying to learn more about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Neural Networks: on FPGA and C++</li>
            <li> ESP32 usage on IoT environments</li>
            <li>Game Design and Patterns</li>
            <li>Kubernetes/Docker</li>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I have worked on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>My First Game Jam (2025):</strong>
                <p>This was my first time participating in a Game Jam. I used Godot (an open-source game engine), C#, and Pixelorama (an open-source pixel art tool). <a href="https://github.com/guijps/game-off-jam">More details can be found in the GitHub repository.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>ESP32 Projects (Ongoing):</strong>
                <p>In the context of IoT, I wanted to explore how "smart" devices communicate with each other. I challenged myself to create a simple project using an ESP32 and a <a href="https://caninosloucos.org/en/labrador-32-en/">Labrador (Caninos Loucos)</a>. The goal is to test different communication methods between the devices to control a lamp. <a href="https://github.com/guijps/esp-32-sample">More details are available in the GitHub repository.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Handwritten Number Recognition - Neural Networks (Python/PyTorch):</strong>
                <p>As part of my experiments to better understand neural networks and their applications, I started by learning the basics using PyTorch. <a href="https://github.com/guijps/neural-network-experiment-python">Click here for more details about this first step.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Handwritten Number Recognition - Neural Networks (C++ from Scratch):</strong>
                <p>This is the second part of my plan to understand neural networks. I implemented a neural network from scratch using C++ without any libraries. The goal was to achieve results similar to the <a href="https://github.com/guijps/neural-network-experiment-python">Python project</a> previously mentioned. <a href="https://github.com/guijps/neural-network-experiment">Click here for more details.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>VIDAOdonto - Firmware and Anesthesiology (Unity, C#, C++, Arduino):</strong>
                <p>As part of the Interlab at the University of São Paulo, I contributed to a project focused on providing reliable and user-friendly solutions for immersive learning technologies. My tasks included: 1) creating a haptic syringe for an anesthesiology simulator, and 2) developing a simulator for studying anesthesiology. <a href="https://github.com/guijps/OldSeringa">More details can be found in the GitHub repository.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>My First Game (2020):</strong>
                <p>This was my first complete game development project. While not technically my first game, it was the first project where I followed through from start to finish. <a href="page-game.html">For more details, visit the project page.</a></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
